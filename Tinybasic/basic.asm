; THE Z80 INSTRUCTION SET ALLOWS FOR 8 ROUTINES IN LOW MEMORY
; THAT MAY BE CALLED BY RST 00H, 08H, 10H, 18H, 20H, 28H, 30H,
; AND 38H.  THIS IS A ONE BYTE INSTRUCTION, AND IS FUNCTIONALLY
; SIMILAR TO THE THREE BYTE INSTRUCTION 'CALL XXXX'. TINY BASIC
; WILL USE THE RST INSTRUCTION FOR THE 7 MOST FREQUENTLY USED
; SUBROUTINES. TWO OTHER SUBROUTINES (CRLF & TSTNUM) ARE ALSO
; IN THIS SECTION. THEY CAN BE REACHED WITH 'CALL'.

; *** MAIN ***
;
; THIS IS THE MAIN LOOP THAT COLLECTS THE TINY BASIC PROGRAM
; AND STORES IT IN THE MEMORY.
;
; AT START, IT PRINTS OUT "(CR)OK(CR)", AND INITIALIZES THE
; STACK AND SOME OTHER INTERNAL VARIABLES.  THEN IT PROMPTS
; ">" AND READS A LINE.  IF THE LINE STARTS WITH A NON-ZERO
; NUMBER, THIS NUMBER IS THE LINE NUMBER.  THE LINE NUMBER
; (IN 16 BIT BINARY) AND THE REST OF THE LINE (INCLUDING CR)
; IS STORED IN THE MEMORY.  IF A LINE WITH THE SAME LINE
; NUMBER IS ALREADY THERE, IT IS REPLACED BY THE NEW ONE.  IF
; THE REST OF THE LINE CONSISTS OF A CR ONLY, IT IS NOT STORED
; AND ANY EXISTING LINE WITH THE SAME LINE NUMBER IS DELETED.
;
; AFTER A LINE IS INSERTED, REPLACED, OR DELETED, THE PROGRAM
; LOOPS BACK AND ASKS FOR ANOTHER LINE.  THIS LOOP WILL BE
; TERMINATED WHEN IT READS A LINE WITH ZERO OR NO LINE
; NUMBER; AND CONTROL IS TRANSFERED TO "DIRECT".
;
; TINY BASIC PROGRAM SAVE AREA STARTS AT THE MEMORY LOCATION
; LABELED "TXTBGN" AND ENDS AT "TXTEND".  WE ALWAYS FILL THIS
; AREA STARTING AT "TXTBGN", THE UNFILLED PORTION IS POINTED
; BY THE CONTENT OF A MEMORY LOCATION LABELED "TXTUNF".
;
; THE MEMORY LOCATION "CURRNT" POINTS TO THE LINE NUMBER
; THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING INTERPRETED.  WHILE WE ARE IN
; THIS LOOP OR WHILE WE ARE INTERPRETING A DIRECT COMMAND
; (SEE NEXT SECTION). "CURRNT" SHOULD POINT TO A 0.

; THE CHARACTER IN A (GIVEN BY THE CALLER), THEN IT FILLS
; THE BUFFER AND ECHOS.  IT IGNORES LF'S AND NULLS, BUT STILL
; ECHOS THEM BACK.  RUB-OUT IS USED TO CAUSE IT TO DELETE
; THE LAST CHARACTER (IF THERE IS ONE), AND ALT-MOD IS USED TO
; CAUSE IT TO DELETE THE WHOLE LINE AND START IT ALL OVER.
; CR SIGNALS THE END OF A LINE, AND CAUSE 'GETLN' TO RETURN.
;
; 'FNDLN' FINDS A LINE WITH A GIVEN LINE # (IN HL) IN THE

; LINE IS FOUND, DE WILL POINT TO THE BEGINNING OF THAT LINE
; (I.E., THE LOW BYTE OF THE LINE #), AND FLAGS ARE NC & Z.
; IF THAT LINE IS NOT THERE AND A LINE WITH A HIGHER LINE #
; IS FOUND, DE POINTS TO THERE AND FLAGS ARE NC & NZ.  IF
; WE REACHED THE END OF TEXT SAVE AREA AND CANNOT FIND THE
; LINE, FLAGS ARE C & NZ.
; 'FNDLN' WILL INITIALIZE DE TO THE BEGINNING OF THE TEXT SAVE
; AREA TO START THE SEARCH.  SOME OTHER ENTRIES OF THIS
; ROUTINE WILL NOT INITIALIZE DE AND DO THE SEARCH.
; 'FNDLNP' WILL START WITH DE AND SEARCH FOR THE LINE #.
; 'FNDNXT' WILL BUMP DE BY 2, FIND A CR AND THEN START SEARCH.
; 'FNDSKP' USE DE TO FIND A CR, AND THEN START SEARCH.
